That comment is so oversimplified it’s insane. I can’t imagine you’re actually a programmer. The fact no one is willing to go into the countless reasons you’re wrong isn’t because you’re right. I have like hundreds of pages of thoughts on this.

To think humans prefer an error prone, probably anti-Vax or alcoholic nurse over a better working scan from a computer is insane. To think an AI would have a harder time with that than keeping an application up and running, monitoring it to make sure no part stops working without real business reasons, improving it and modernizing to stay competitive, expanding functionality for new needs etc. is laughable as well. Even if it could, who tells the AI what to do and where not to modify things? Expansion of productivity of programmers doesn’t mean less programming work, it means more getting accomplished. On the other hand we can’t expand the demand for nursing work because it’s inelastic. Once the tools are there in theory a handful of human nurses could be the only human part of a nursing functionality for a whole country.

They're great for performing tasks that require precision or to work in non ideal conditions.  But it comes at a cost.  

They don't get tired on a daily scale but on a larger scale, for example, periodic maintenance and repairs.  If there's a condition that's out of their ability to cope, they just stop.

Sure, but ""startup time"" doesn't really need optimization. Everyone coming at coding for the first time thinks that it is the thing in most need of optimization, so they come up with yet another rapid prototyping tool and still projects get delayed or canceled without ever being delivered.

There are many, many problems in software development: small bugs that take forever to debug and work around, unrealistic delivery timelines, organizational cruft, unclear requirements, constantly changing requirements, lack of vision, lack of imagination, lack of market research, etc. etc. etc. ChatGPT and other ""rapid prototyping"" technologies solve none of these problems.

Over the years, ""startup time"" and rapid prototyping have become far, far easier, but software projects still get delayed all the time.

Governments are generally aware of the potential for AI to disrupt employment and create massive unemployment. However, the exact impact of AI on employment is still difficult to predict and may vary across different industries and job types.

Some experts believe that while AI may displace certain jobs, it may also create new opportunities and industries. For example, as AI becomes more widespread, there may be increased demand for workers skilled in AI development and maintenance.

Additionally, many governments are taking steps to prepare their workforce for the impact of AI. This includes investing in education and training programs to help workers acquire the skills they need to adapt to the changing job market.

Finally, governments also recognize the importance of implementing policies to support workers who may be displaced by AI. This includes providing unemployment benefits, job training, and other support services to help workers transition to new careers.

Barring a black swan type of event what's predicted is most likely what's going to happen.  Zero sum game.

Go out into the actual world and do one day of interaction with the things ""normal people"" interact.  Notice how literally none of those things can be automated by a chatbot in the next 3, 5, 10 years.

Realize then that this will impact \*sectors\* of the workforce and not the entirety of the workforce.  Coding, art, marketing, writing, graphic design, website building.

Since it's only set to decimate the jobs available in those sectors it's accounted for that the jobs created as a result of an emergent tech will make up for those netting about 0% change over all.

Research into jobs displacement due to AI is a discipline that is well funded by private and government sectors and you can actually have your career in this field already for awhile now.  It's not like society is out here just waiting to be caught out with it's pants down.  We live in a data driven society already for a long time and the data is paramount for policy making and decision making across the board from the top to the bottom of our corporate driven society.  So if you personally were interested in actually knowing, you yourself could go and read some of this data, these papers, check out what the government in conjunction with it's corporate think tanks have in the works and what they're saying.   I will sum it up for you though, it's zero sum, about 0% is projected over the next 10 years.

Because go outside.  Go get a burrito.  Is anyone in there going to lose a job? Are the bots going to be making the salsa?  Go get your brakes fixed after that.  Is anyone in there going to be using a chatbot on their phone to change the pads and try to tell you that your rotors are shot and you need new ones of those too?

The tech likely can't be stopped, even the strongest anti-AI policies will still result in AI displacing increasingly more and more workers, albeit at a slower rate than without anti-AI policies. 

Automation is reaching a point that very soon, even jobs like construction will be almost entirely automated soon, with various systems controlling excavators, bulldozers, even smaller powertools and specialized equipment far more efficiently than any human crew can, and without having to worry about sick days or union strikes, and much lower operating costs in the long-term.

A job that might take 20 supervisors and 100 workers 6 months, could instead take only 10 supervisors and a maintenance crew 2 months, with the equipment provider charging a % of the final contract to rent a handful of automated construction drones. 

Given that impending economic reality, why would any company choose a human-operated heavy construction crew? Computers don't make mistakes near as often as humans do, and work 'round the clock without breaks. 

And why would any human WANT to take on those jobs. Even now (in the US) workers are paid very little for ""simple"" jobs like operating machinery, or road construction, and they're dangerous jobs too! The SECOND it becomes economically viable to replace those workers, the company absolutely will. 

Meanwhile, globally, the wealth disparity between the wealthiest people and everyone else continues to grow. 

The vast majority of people won't be able to sell their time in exchange for the resources they need to survive. I'd argue the majority of people worldwide can barely do so now.

Meanwhile, corporations will continue to agglomerate, and the financiers will only gain more and more money, demanding more and more growth from a economic system on a planet that fundamentally cannot sustain infinite growth.

We humans are clearly in a spiral, where do we go from here?



To be clear, my question presupposes 4 major future events:

1. Resources will become increasingly scarce due to our global economy's utter failure to properly address climate change by ending fossil fuel usage, and the resulting resource wars will only drain dwindling energy resources further. 

2. Wealth will continue to concentrate amongst those who already have a great deal of wealth, and corporations will continue to grow larger and more anti-competitive, even in the best cases solely by sheer economy of scale factors.

3. Specialized AIs and control systems will continue to improve and be introduced into new industries wherever economical for the wealthy owners/investors of nearly all forms of industry.

4. Fusion either doesn't become economical, or is so slow to roll out, that it doesn't end up mattering in the global scale. This one might be a wild card.",21,1674243078.0

The best case is AI is overhyped, and we get an industrial revolution scenario; many people lose their jobs, but new industries arise. The changes still create new political ideologies, the same way communism came into existence in response to the industrial revolution.

The worst case is AGI happens. Workers are completely replaced in most industries, and any new jobs created are easily performed by AI. This breaks any socioeconomic model based on human labour. No form of government or economy in today’s world can handle this. The only options are UBI or mass chaos. Violent revolutions are not uncommon during times of extreme economic turmoil. Even if we go with UBI, huge changes will occur; either the government nationalizes AI companies, or the companies become the government. Democracy is likely gone either way. No UBI?

The average household net worth in the US is now over $1M. 

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL192090005A
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TTLHH

Of course the median is much lower. 

There has been an increase in magnitude about every 50 years since 1900. That is the average yearly income was about $500 in 1900, $5,000 in 1950, and $50,000 in 2000. So $500,000 by 2050? It sounds crazy, but is completely plausible based on our current path. 

Or consider the value of $20 since 1900.

Year	Time to earn $20
1900	2 weeks
1925	5 days
1950	Day and a half
1975	Half a day
2000	A couple hours

The expected trend
2025	Half an hour
2050	10 minutes 
2075	3 minutes
2100	1 minute

The rule of 72 suggests prices will double every 24 years with an average inflation of 3%. 

Yet all of the above is merely the veil of money and hides phenomenal changes in society, technology, and economies of scale. The energy requirements for a modern standard of living increased dramatically over the last century as homes added modern amenities, yet has started to flatten over the last couple decades. Improvements are mostly incremental now. Standard appliances have not really changed since the advent of the microwave and color television mid-century. They have added a few more bells and whistles. The average house or car is certainly better than 1950, yet outside of computers, most items are comparable to previous generations.

A party to protect the farmers has just got a lot of votes in the election, because farmers got mad that they will be forced to downscale or close down to hit carbon emission targets. 

This party is saying we should change the target to 2035, and just do nothing about the problem for now, however I personally believe that within the next five years we will see huge progress being made with ""clean meat/cultured meat"" which will make animal farming redundant and force them to close anyway.

839,jdkdms7,ChatGPT,"In my experience, ChatGPT with the GPT-4 module has been pretty incredible at writing code, revising, adding features with very little input, and even providing me with unit tests and other test harnesses I can use to exercise and validate the code it produces, etc.

I will say, however, that the results I get depend heavily on what language I'm asking it to code in. For example, its C++ coding skills seem a bit weaker than its skills with higher level languages such as Python or especially scripting (BASH, PowerShell, etc), but I suspect this is in part due to the fact that in C++ it has to be told more about the operating environment, which of course matters much more for lower level languages.

I get mind-blowing results when scripting BASH. It just saves me a ton of time with IT admin tasks. If I ask it to make a script and I use clear language, I hardly ever have to ask for any corrections to be made. Even when I do, it's a simple sentence and done.

A colleague of mine is using it to code his SCRUM user stories (all in C#/.NET) with little more than what's on the notecard and some existing code to provide it with context. He also saves a ton of time and seems to be spending a lot less time asking GPT for corrections or to fix its bugs.

861,jcipuzd,ChatGPT,"I think it's jumping the proverbial gun to worry about the effects AI will have on the job market in 2-3 years because we don't really know what the capabilities of AI will be in 2-3 years. Depending on who you ask, we could be anywhere from reaching the technological singularity to being right about where we're at now (I lean towards the latter if you can't tell).

And that aside, we're already having a theoretical discussion when we talk about the impact of AI on jobs because there hasn't yet been a large-scale disruption of employment due to AI. If we're going to have this discussion at all I think it makes sense to keep it to one theoretical concept at a time rather than theorizing about theoretical technology we haven't even got yet. It's like talking about the impact that Quantum Computers will have on digital transactions, banking and other forms of online security just because we have demonstrated basic quantum computing viability.

Why do I think that AI is destined to hit a brick wall in terms of advancement? Because underneath the hood it's just numbers. 0s and 1s. A series of good algorithms is useful at finding patterns, but it's not magic and it's not sentient.

I remember when everyone thought we would have cars flying all over the place by 2020 and the widespread fear that self-driving EVs would replace the need for drivers. Ironically, autopilot has pretty much remained stagnant and we've seen an explosion in the need for drivers from grocery deliver services such as Shipt, Door Dash, GrubHub, Instacart and Spark to UPS/USPS/FedEx and Amazon drivers, truckers to transport goods to warehouses, Gig transportation services like Uber, etc.",7,1679021344.0

The problem is always the distribution of wealth. If more jobs are being automated, the resulting products or services could be cheaper or even free. In theory, if all jobs were automated completely, nobody would have to work anymore at all.

AI specifically is a bit of a complicated topic. A lot of people don't really understand what it is. And often, not even the experts who created them can understand them completely (that's basically the idea). That in itself is the greatest danger if AI.

There's honestly no reason why an AI like ChatGPT couldn't ""interview"" someone. Not face to face, of course, but it's perfectly feasible that it could be given access to email, twitter, etc, locate a person it deems an authority on a subject, and ask them questions, much in the same way a journalist might.

>nor can it find historical documents

Yes, it absolutely can. That's kind of how they work. The only caveat being that those historical documents have to be online somewhere. I suppose maybe the author means ""Historical documents sitting in a box in a basement somewhere"", in which case, valid point.
