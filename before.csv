What will really happen is that someone will invent a toilet for hospice patients that automates the ass-wiping process, then an Alexa-like assistant will be introduced as the first tier of response to call lights and phoned requests for medical issues.

None of these things will remove the need to have people involved in the process, they'll just need less people as well as less highly trained people involved because fewer calls and steps in the process of care will require human intervention.

But what's cool about this particular area of automation is that as you lower the cost and labor required to care for humans throughout their life, we can afford to support more people with the same budget of money and people. So you probably won't lose your job, you'll just care for more patients and have a lot fewer duties to take care of with each one.

So for your job, robots will very likely *eventually* be able to do your job, but it'll be a long time coming, and in the process your job will become less and less technically demanding so you can be more productive and have more people in your field (assuming demand). So it'll make your job easier and easier until the work is basically unskilled labor, but that process is iterative and long, so first a robot will install a few components, or maybe automatically dig out and fill in a foundation from a schematic. Each of these automations that require robotics will take a long time to implement (although less time on the software side than before because deep learning automates a lot of the development process) and often have to build off of each other.

40,dve7r18,Futurology,"That's really the way automation tends to move, to automate technical jobs so that they rely less and less on narrow-skill labor. Kind of how we have gradually automated computer programming, so coders go from needing to understand binary to machine language to higher and higher levels of abstraction. This means it takes less technical skill to be a programmer, so you don't have to pay 30 specialists a ton of money to make a small program and can instead pay 5 generally skilled programmers a lot less to do the same job.

The cool thing about this is that in the right conditions automation actually empowers small business by letting them hire fewer workers to accomplish bigger tasks.

Surgeon - we already have remote surgery being done. Those feeds, between automated unit and surgeon are streams of a data. Data a learning algorithm can and probably will be able to learn from. If a computer can drive a car, it can perform surgery.

What I mean is, how easy a job can be automated is dependent on how easy it is to obtain the required data. Once you have the data you can automate the job; it's a done deal. How long it takes for that data to be turned into an automated solution corresponds to data mining and processing. But basically, if you have the data, it's done. 
 
How do you, for example, gather the data required to automate a family doctor? How about a General Manager position? CEO? The more generalized a job is the more challenging it is to collect the data required to train the AI. 
 
To draw out from what you were saying, it could be said that another challenge is how to categorize the data, but I'm less concerned about that. The speed and efficiency at which we can categorize and mine data is one aspect of AI that does seem to be growing in an exponential fashion. So I doubt that hurdle will be much of a hurdle in a few years time. 
 
Though, it could be said that with that hurdle (data processing/mining) out of the way, just putting cameras everywhere might be enough.

Yes we very much are.

We actually don't have any AI currently, what people refer to as AI is actually a small subset called machine learning. Machine learning is pattern matching and prediction and requires MASSIVE datasets to provide any value.

It basically maps out the sensory input part of your brain (the pre-frontal cortex), the part that sees, hears etc. It can be applied to other things as well, treating those as ""senses"", e.g. advertising where consumer trends become a sense and it predicts future trends.

However it is not a thinking machine. It simply doesn't even attempt to map that part of our brain. So it can't do something like figure out what a client wants.

For those of you not familiar with programming, programming is not really much of a technical challenge. There certainly are technical challenges that will be faced, but most of those have already been automated (in the form of higher level languages or libraries). What remains is essentially just figuring out what the hell people actually want. Programming is taking vague statements that someone says and turning it into very precise statements that a computer requires.

-A lot of jobs are a lot more complex and have a lot of ""edge cases"" that require physical and inutitive capabilities of humans.  People here oversimplify jobs that they've never worked (like those thinking plumbers can be easy to automate).  I think for a period we will have ""augmented"" jobs with AI, and yes, this will drive down wages.
-This stuff takes time to go from lab to practice.  If we get it running in a lab (or self-driving cars), this does not mean 100% of human labor will be replaced by it in 2 years or 5 years.  When self-driving cars become mainstream to purchase, it will still likely take a decade or two to fully replace human driven cars (a number of reports by those outside the echo chamber say at most 25% by 2029).

That statement is pretty useless on it's own though. 25% of the workforce will be out of work in the next several decades because that's the rate that people leave the work force (age 20-60, assuming roughly equal distribution you'd have 25% of people leave it every 10 years).

If it's talking about percentage of jobs we have currently that won't need to be filled, well yes no duh. That's also something that's always happened throughout history (as technology develops and people's jobs shift).

Definitely, which is why I always bring the conversation down to specifics rather than generalizations. I find it best to talk about someone's specific situation. What do they do at work and how automation will change that.

> and yes, this will drive down wages

Even if it did that'd be because companies all chose to race to the bottom in cutting costs rather than the much more attractive option of increasing quality/production. I really don't think this is the case (most people would chose a 2x increase in quality over current prices rather than a 50% decrease in cost), but even if it was that'd mean stuff is cheaper now and your lower wages will go farther.

My comment refers to resources that we are depleting extremely quickly: trees, clean water, helium, phosphorous, and so on.

Helium is necessary for supercooling electronics and for some medical applications, but we use it to fill balloons for children's birthdays. [Phophorous](http://phosphorusfutures.net/) is only found in a few places and we need it to grow food. We have enough for maybe 100 more years.

At the very least, mining these elements from hard-to-reach places like the ocean or the arctic will simply become more expensive, but even then they won't last forever. Some, like trees, can be easily replaced by planting seeds or saplings in areas where they were cut down, but lack of money or will means we're still on track to [cut down all forests](https://www.quora.com/How-long-until-all-forests-are-gone) in about 500 years.

(repetitive factory and mining and construction jobs are one of the easiest things to automate and easily fit in that 50%)

&#x200B;

None of these resource problems, *except* for the helium one, mean jack shit if we have that kind of industrial ability.  For one thing, the only thing *consumed* is energy (and helium).  Do you know why we don't mine garbage for minerals or use robots to sift through all garbage?  Because we can't afford it vs the cost of mining new.  (too much human labor, robotic machinery is presently too expensive and ineffective.  Garbage is actually a lot more complex to process than an ore seam with a certain percentage of the mineral you are after).  That totally changes once these AI systems you decry become readily available.

&#x200B;

The helium one...well, fortunately we discovered high temperature superconductors decades ago, and they have a number of advantages.  For the vanishingly small use cases where you *must* use liquid helium\*, I guess we will have to be more careful with the remaining supply.  I agree with you it's a shame we are wasting it frivolously but it's not like we couldn't make more with fusion if it really came to it, or get it from deeper on this planet, or mine other planets.

Play computer games? Garden?

Humans, as a species, are born to work. Our earliest ancestors had to search for food from the time they woke up until the time they slept. We invented farming and that freed some of us up for other jobs, like making cool chairs or shovels or bolt-action rifles or particle colliders, but what will we do when nobody needs to farm, or make chairs, or make guns so we can kill each other? This isn't some situation where industrialization is ramping up and housewives are worried that they won't be able to sell their handmade quilts for a living anymore. We built quilt making machines and hired millions of housewives to make billions of quilts. But now? We're building robots to replace the housewives, so that the same job gets done but the housewives aren't involved. We aren't doing this to make more jobs or to improve old ones; *we're deleting them.* Good news for the handful of people who are hired and trained to work on the quilt-making machines.

I disagree entirely. They will only get worse. We'll experience a few decades where we delay the inevitable because underwater robots are mining otherwise hard-to-reach minerals, but what happens when those run out? You talk about garbage like that's the end game solution, but we have to keep mining because most minerals are simply getting used. You won't find most of the steel we make in the trash, since we use it to make buildings. But let's say we reach 100% recycling thanks to ""those AI systems I decry."" (Note that the AI will be doing the digging, not people. More jobs lost.) We will still need to mine more once we use everything we've mined so far.

67,ed1refe,Futurology,"Ok, this discussion is getting muddled.  You're talking about 2 separate issues :

1.  The potential loss of a lot of jobs (it's not 3.5 billion, 100% of the world's population is not in the workforce.  Even in the USA, only 62.8 percent of the population is considered to be ""participating"" in the labor force and this excludes people considered too old and too young to work)

2.  Running out of resources.  I assume you mean things like copper and rare earths, since aluminium and iron and carbon are so common you'd be absurd to come to that position.  

The first issue is a complex subject and one that I partially agree with you on, it's a massive potential issue.  The second is a simple factual one and you're clearly wrong.

What I was trying to explain to you that when humans mine up copper or vanadium or anything else, it doesn't get ""used up"".  Every last gram, except for losses in things like space probes that are so small to be negligible, is still here on Earth somewhere.  In some cases the metal got dissolved in water or something or lost in the bottom of a landfill or ocean trench but it's all still present and recoverable.  

You talk about ""a few decades"" of delaying ""the inevitable"" : have you done jack shit of the most cursory research on this?  Did you even look at which areas of the world have been mined, how deep is considered ""economically viable"" by today's standards, or how much is remaining?  

Even the most cursory analysis would indicate that the amount remaining is greater than 95%.  That's because there is all the areas of all of the earth deeper than any present mine, obviously limited by ultimate depth because eventually you hit magma, as well as all the oceans, the poles, Siberia, vast chunks of Africa and South America and Canada and the mountains of Mongolia and all those mineral deposits that are lower concentration and the ocean water itself and...

Hell, even Australia has portions too remote to economically mine even though there are vast deposits there as well.

And once we exhaust all that, we could just go dig up all our garbage using robots that can actually see, have the robots find stuff they recognize and from a reinforcement learning algorithm harvest things high in whatever mineral we are low on.

Did you even look at mineral prices?  Your ""peak mineral"" theory would be correlated with increasing prices.  Except they aren't increasing, actually, as in the last decade worldwide industrial output has increased greatly but so have new mines opened.  Copper is down from it's 2010 peak.  (the debunked theory of ""peak oil"" has turned out to be complete bull, at this point the problem is ""peak atmosphere"" - the oil companies have found enough KNOWN reserves to turn our planet uninhabitable)

Oh, and the motherload.  The Moon.  The moon is a solid mass that is either completely solid or has a very small molten core.  So it's ALL mineable.  There is actually more accessible mass in the Moon than the Earth's entire crust, because less of it is molten, and it has a similar elemental mix.

But the Moon is very hard to reach, right?  Ten thousand dollars a kilogram just for low Earth orbit.  What am I smoking?  Well, this is actually well thought out, but I'm going to see if you can work it out for yourself.  Assume you have AI good enough that the same software can use multiple types of robotic waldo and perform all the steps of manufacturing, given only 3d models of the resulting product at each step, and this works for all forms of manufacturing.

1,ehxjc28,Futurology,"This is kind of silly. Based on my understanding of the study, they just identified a number of occupations within the government that can be affected by AI and added up all the employees in those categories. The inherent problem with that approach is that it assumes that the job title is a 100% description of what the person does; aka an accountant only ever sits at their desk and crunches numbers on excel. The range of activities a given job does usually surpasses the job title, aka a lot of soft-skill tasks that computers can't automate (at least not for a long while). So perhaps many of the tasks these workers do can be automated, but that leaves the other tasks that cannot be automated. 

The same thinking applies to many other industries that have been identified as at huge risk to automation. Take truck drivers. AVs for trucking are already being rolled out. Does this mean trucking is going to disappear as a job? Unlikely, because truck drivers don't JUST drive. They perform a ton of edge cases that technology isn't even close to performing yet, so yes, there will be many trucks that drive themselves, but will likely require a human ""copilot"" on board for those edge cases.

there it is. ""equitable."" there's no faster way to identify a marxist than the use of that word. if you're using that word, you're a marxist. 

capitalism is the tide that raises all boats across the world. it improves the standard of living for everyone. you marxists want everyone to focus on the discrepancy between rich and poor though, and ignore that poor people have today what only rich people had just a few years ago, and it's always been this way. you want everyone to focus on relative poverty (the gap between rich and poor) instead of real poverty--it's the only way your little scheme even starts to sound like it could possibly make some sense. but truly socialist/communist countries are nowhere to be found, except venezuela, because like venezuela, they all collapse in a matter of a few years. it's a stupid notion based on false premises and history has already proven it 100 times over. stop fucking falling for it. 

you would have us go backward though. you'd have high school and college students believe their educations can make them smart enough to decide who needs what and how much even though it's an impossible task. free markets accomplish it constantly. if you really can't look around america and see the paradise you live in right now, if you really can't see how free trade has lifted every country that embraces it, then you'd have your head in a book too long and not in the real world. equality of outcome is not possible. the best we can strive for is equality of opportunity by ensuring that laws do not disproportionately favor anyone in particular. stealing from one to give from another doesn't work.

Capitalism is definitely a good system to help a transition early on, but capitalism as we know it cannot really exist in the world you've described.

Unpopular hot take but I really don't think ""AI"" is as close enough to nuanced decision making as folks are making out. What most people call AI is really machine learning, and the best ML algorithms can do today is automate repetitive knowledge tasks. I spent the last two years taking classes in ML and, coming from a social science background where we use quantitative models to do ""nuanced decision making"", yeah, it's really not as close as the tech evangelists make it out. Heck, my course had access to an IBM Watson instance and it's 90% marketing 10% real innovation (it doesn't do anything that Google search doesn't already). There's a running joke that the majority of AI companies' have developed more powerpoint slide decks than any real tech.

I'm not saying it won't happen. But the timelines that will get us there are much longer than the evangelists make out (for good measure, they need the R&D $$ today). Frankly, what we'll see are slow and steady advances in optimization models until those who can be automated away retire and the rest of the workforce has evolved with the changes. Let's switch from the ATM scenario to the PC disruption of typists and secretaries. What happened to all those secretaries? Every firm used to have 3-4 secretaries for even low-level managers.

The jobless future scenario assumes that what we call ""work"" will never evolve beyond what we can envision today. Go back a few years and ""social media manager"" was some made up title for an unpaid millennial intern who needed to pad their resume. Now it's a core component of PR.

I don't have specific examples off the bat and I apologize for that, but you may see a shifting down of roles on a company by company basis but overall employment continues and new roles are invented even as old ones disappear. My main argument is that the only way automation will take us to joblessness is if you assume 1) the size of the economy is limited and therefore there are only so many jobs that can ever be performed and 2) the nature of the economy and of what we consider ""work"" will never evolve past what it is today, therefore a job that exists today, once automated, is gone forever and that new generations of workers will only gain the same skills that previous generations did.

No kiddo, see here's where your education has failed you. In capitalism, RELATIVE wealth ends up in the hands of the few. REAL wealth happens for everybody. Unlike communism, which quickly starves itself to death. If you haven't actually lived in a 3rd world country like i have (mexico), then you really can't fathom how amazingly wealthy even the RELATIVELY poorest of americans are in this country. Nobody is leaving this country to try to seek a better life in Mexico or anywhere south of there. Nobody leaves the United States seeking for a better life elsewhere. There aren't ICE and border patrol agents capturing and sending poor americans back to where they came from. You know why? Because we have REAL WEALTH in America. Across the board.

“There are four ways in which you can spend money.  You can spend your own money on yourself.  When you do that, why then you really watch out what you’re doing, and you try to get the most for your money.  Then you can spend your own money on somebody else.  For example, I buy a birthday present for someone.  Well, then I’m not so careful about the content of the present, but I’m very careful about the cost.  Then, I can spend somebody else’s money on myself.  And if I spend somebody else’s money on myself, then I’m sure going to have a good lunch!  Finally, I can spend somebody else’s money on somebody else.  And if I spend somebody else’s money on somebody else, I’m not concerned about how much it is, and I’m not concerned about what I get.  And that’s government.  And that’s close to 40% of our national income.”",1,1551967823.0

http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/03/20/ray-kurzweils-predictions-for-2009-were-mostly-inaccurate/#2ffd64bb441c

And that was just for 2009.  Ray Kurzweil has made a lot of predictions that are still quite a bit away in the future, so we will just have to wait and see if his predictions come to fruition or not, but there are plenty of other predictions that he made for the early 2000s, early 21st century, 2010, 2010s, and 2015 that we can analyze to see whether or not he's a credible source for future predictions.  

For my analysis, I'll just reference the wikipedia article ""Predictions made by Ray Kurzweil"" (see link below)

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil#The_Age_of_Intelligent_Machines_.281990.29

In the ""Age of Spiritual Machines""(1990), he made a number of predictions, such as that telephones letting people talk to each other in different languages, machines transcribing speech, exoskeletal, robotic leg protheses, and cybernetic chaffeurs, and screening in telephones, which don't seem to have really happened at least not outside of a laboratory where it isn't available to the general public like he made it out to be.  For the early 21st century, he predicted that the classroom is dominated by computer systems, maybe that is the case for being able to get lecture notes offline but the bulk of taking a class is going to a lecture hall, taking notes, and studying just like it's been for a long time.  To be fair, one of his prediction for 2010 was that PC's are capable of queries by accessing information wirelessly via the internet and that happened with search engines, but other predictions are a little out of the way.  For the early 21st century, drugs are tested in clinical trials instead of being tested in a simulation of the human body, blind people don't navigate using machines, and a small number of highly skilled people don't completely dominate the entire production sector.  Maybe one can say that all of these predictions did come true and I'm just full of shit, but at that point we are starting to blur the definition of his predictions so how could he predict wrong?  For the Singularity is Near, He predicted that Supercomputers will have the same computing power as the human brain, but that is giving him a little too much credit.  The computational capacity of the human brain, according to Kurzweil himself, is ~20 petaflops (which is a low estimate compared to IBM's estimate of ~37 petaflops), which is less than the speed of IBM Sequoia anyway since it has a speed of 16.32 PFlops and it wasn't even delivered till 2011 and was only deployed by June of 2012.  He also made a prediction that by 2015, a ""clean a house"" will be within the capabilities of a household robot, God I wish that prediction came true.  He made accurate predictions for saying in the 2010s VR glasses will develop, more computer devices will be used for web servers, and high quality Internet access will be available everywhere, but he falls short with saying advertisements will utilize a new technology whereby two ultrasonic beams can be targeted to intersect at a specific point, delivering a localized sound message that only a single person can hear, cell phones can be built into clothing, computers will become smaller (smart phones had a big break in the first 2 years in this decade and now it has not been developing much more), and people aren't close to being able to reprogram their genes to live longer.  Finally, and probably most important point of all, Moore's Law has slowed down since 2009 instead of his prediction that it would continue relentlessly,  see article below:

I legitimately don't know how programming is going to be distrusted by AI's. I've heard this a lot but 90% of programming for a position is negotiating with clients/managers to get requirements. If there the AI becomes sentient and strangles the manager until they get their requirement inline then yes, programming will distrusted. But legitimately speaking, AI has create more jobs in programming than it's gotten rid of most of it.

If more and more jobs can get replaced through automation, less and less work will actually be necessary to be performed by humans.

It's basically the same development we had when the industrialisation/modernisation went through. Now people didn't need to work off their backs turning around earth and devote their life to agricultural seasons - they can use harrows and tractors. 

Now, people don't need to work overtime in thousands of jobs booking and organising appointments, programs can take over.

If people aren't preoccupied with having to fill jobs that can be replaced by programs, there is more space in job fields elsewhere, as well as in newly developed areas of work.

Yes, a single company may be able to shed hundreds of jobs, but how many new companies could open due to emerging technology? Look at radio.

Today there are far more podcasts than radio stations and they can still be profitable and get ad revenue. Arguably *more* people can get into broadcasting now and so the loss of radio station jobs is irrelevant.

If you have to hire that same person back to maintain the AI, not only are you still paying the same number of salaries, but you are likely paying a much higher salary since an AI programmer is a higher-skill job than a grocery store clerk. This means that if a company is making a switch to AI, they are doing it to reduce the number of people on payroll.

Now, some people might say ""The people getting fired can just get a job at an AI-making-company!"". The person saying this is an idiot too.

>If you find a $10 once a year, every year, what new industry will arise?  Does that $10 change your spending habits? Are you going to buy some  new device? Invest in art? How does that build an industry? 

If every American spends $10 more each year at one company, that would $3.2bil in revenue being spent in the economy on goods and services that did not previously exist.  This is roughly one new Fortune 500 company worth of revenue being allocated towards new goods/services.  Many industries are built upon the good ideas of one company.

In response to the spending habits part of the comment, it is hard to say what people will spend their money on.  Steve Jobs once famously said

>Some people say, ""Give the customers what they want."" But that's not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, ""If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, 'A faster horse!'"" People don't know what they want until you show it to them. That's why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.

There is some Steve-Jobs-like person somewhere right now waiting to start a new $3.2bil startup to create something new and manufacture demand out of thin air.  Before we started putting chlorine in the water, people thought that cholera was just a part of life and accepted living with it not thinking that there was some alternative.

67,gx6fb6n,changemyview,"I think the current wave of automation will be different, in ways which make it more disruptive. There are three reasons for this:

a) The economy has three broad sectors, which have existed for thousands of years: agriculture, manufacturing, and services. The first wave was in agriculture, and people could find adjacent work or switched to working in manufacturing. The second wave was in manufacturing, and people could find work in services. The current wave is affecting all three at the same time, but there is no fourth sector of the economy left for workers to switch to.

2) Agricultural automation was largely about tasks: a digging machine, a seeding machine, a pulling machine. Manufacturing automation took robots performing defined sequences of tasks. But in both cases these were specific - any task or series of tasks which had not been specifically automated was still work to be had. The new wave of automation is entire skill sets. This means when a job is lost to automation, all similar jobs are going away at the same time. There will be no adjacent work for people to switch to.

3) Speed. When automation was physical machines, they had to design them, and build them, and ship them, and customers had to rebuild their own factories to use manufacturing robots. Modern automation is largely software driven, which is practically free to copy and distribute. As soon as the method is ready, it can be picked up by businesses as fast as they can rent server space to run it.

&#x200B;

>One company?

Economic changes don't work out in nice clean numbers.  I was simply trying to attach a scale to an amount of money that you were brushing off as ""*only* $10 a year per person"", and show that that scale was significant in terms of revenue.  It's called an ""order of magnitude estimation"" and is useful when making estimates about complex topics.  Theoretically, it could be the case that all of the new disposable income could go to one company.  But it doesn't need to go to one new company.  One new Fortune 500 company's worth of goods and services could be created in multiple different business or in existing business selling new products, and this would be significant.  

&#x200B;

>Huh. So what company will we all invest in?  

I will assume that by ""invest in"" you mean ""buy goods or services from"".  I would encourage you to take inventory of the goods and services that you have bought in the past (and plan to buy in the future) and ask yourself why you are paying money for those specific items?  Why do you choose to buy anything as opposed to nothing (or an alternative option)?  In our hypothetical scenario, you would spend the $10 per year for the same reasons that you spend all the other money that you spend.

&#x200B;

>Do we all do  it on one day, so it is reflected on the books as something other than a  statistical anomaly? 

When I said that the money was roughly the size of Fortune 500 company I was comparing annual revenue.  So it doesn't matter how it is spent, just that it averages out to that total over the course of the year.  And I don't see why you think $3.2b is an insignificant amount of money, which what I assume you are doing when referring to it as ""just a statistical anomaly"".  It is definitely

But [Politifact explains](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/jul/18/george-will/do-tax-preparers-outnumber-firefighters-and-police/) that this number is actually only people that are *only* employed with their primary title of ""tax preparer"", and it didn't count the other 700k people who additionally have tax preparer licenses but were self employed with jobs like attorney, accountant, etc.  Either way, unless you are in the upper management at one of these companies, or a knowledgeable investment manager who has deep knowledge of an industry, you have no clue how new technology is going to affect the allocation of capital.  I guarantee that Amazon is not going to automate 1.2m jobs at the flick of a switch.  And if they do (in the extremely unlikely case), then there will negative consequences in the short term, but it will be positive in the long term.  Those people can stop doing some easily automated task and can start doing a new task that needs to be done that can't yet be automated.  This has been occurring throughout the entire industrial period of human existence.  

We, as humans, used to have to wake up every morning and farm all day by hand with simple wood and metal tools--almost every human on earth did this.  Today, we sit on our ass while people in other countries harvest food with GPS guided self-driving tractors in gigantic fields that are covered with synthetic fertilizers which are manufactured in chemical plants from raw materials which are mined from the earth or extracted from the atmosphere, and once the food is harvested it is loaded into trucks with automatic internal combustion engines which propel the heavy truck at speeds and distances not achievable by biological land mammals or onto large boats that can travel safely deep into the oceans to deliver the food between continents.  Then, all you have to do is get in your automatic car and drive down the grocery store and pick it up off the shelf, and you save yourself an entire days worth of farming (not to mention the nutrition would be much, much better, on top of having much larger portions too).  

So many steps that process have been ""automated"" in some way, and at one point humans probably had much more direct involvement in all of those steps in that chain (i.e. planting and harvesting by hand, plowing by hand or with a horse, spreading fertilizer, building water management system (before sprinklers and piped water), driving goods to market with a horse, and so on.  Those were all jobs that people had to do, and many of those jobs were ""automated"" away at some point.  One of the greatest job losses in human history has been in the farming sector.  For example, jobs in farming in the US went from 11.7m in 1910  to 2.05m in 2015 (while at the same time the population went from  92.41m to  320.7m).  It still takes some labor to carryout steps in that chain (bringing food to stores), but the labor is much more efficient since it has all the help from heavy machinery assisting with certain processes.  But just because the jobs were lost from one sector does not mean that they were lost from the economy.  These transitions happen over time and employees move as the market changes.  The same will be true for the tax industry (which I suspect is already occurring based on the BLS data cited in the Politifact article I linked vs the actual link the current BLS numbers).",1,1620360874.0

Doing whatever you want is a much different concept then working in the entertainment industry because those are the only jobs that exist. Post scarcity Utopia where peoples needs are met I can get on board with.  The other I can't imagine being a functional society, entertainment industry is at its core a popularity contest.  The people the succeed are the popular ones.  Everyone can't be popular.

[The 212,000 figure includes those things.](https://data.bls.gov/projections/nationalMatrix?queryParams=710000&ioType=i) With the possible exception of some workers in the video game industry. Though some of them most likely fall under the category of Self Employed, the question is how many.  Looking at that number 722,000 of those jobs across the US exist, but that includes all forms of self employment. Lets be generous and say half of those jobs are entertainment. That is only another 361,000 jobs in ""entertainment"" that currently exist.  We are still at less then half a percent of the current population providing entertainment for the entire country.  And then you have to think about how many of those jobs could be performed by an AI.",2,1620327525.0

Oh, I see, they just need to [move and get new job skills](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/12/beattyville-kentucky-and-americas-poorest-towns). Somehow this plan seems familiar. I'm not sure where [from, though](https://www.industryweek.com/talent/article/22028380/the-abandonment-of-small-cities-in-the-rust-belt).

Farm efficiency allowed the consolidation of farms into [industrialized concerns](http://jaysonlusk.com/blog/2016/6/26/the-evolution-of-american-agriculture). It lowered the number of farm workers, which coincided nicely with a couple of world wars and industrialization. Half of all farms today earn under $25K (citation above). 

The automation of farm jobs allowed people to move to cities, and work manufacturing jobs. The offshoring of manufacturing broke the rust belt. Sure, we have high paying tech jobs, but we also have dead cities with opiate problems. [We have coal towns with nothing left.](https://www.milkenreview.org/articles/abandoned-by-coal-swallowed-by-opioids) We have [manufacturing towns with nothing left.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/09/the-last-refrigerator/380154/) . 

This assumes that there will be a replacement industry of some kind. Automation increases efficiency and frees time. What jobs will *not* be open for AI/ML replacement? Electric cars have fewer moving parts, reducing need for mechanics, and cars designed to be repaired by machine are here. Zoom will transcribe your meeting for you. Google will translate it into another language. Small companies used to have bookkeepers, now one person uses Quickbooks. HR departments have been replaced by Salesforce. Amazon has stores with no cashiers. Self driving cabs are maybe a decade away. I can check into a hotel with no human interaction. We like some human contact, but how many restaurant servers do we need and while I enjoyed my time in the service industry, I am glad to be done with it and working normal hours. In five years a computer will absolutely do 90% of my job- *and my official job title has AI/ML in it*. Two years ago I spent 6 hours on a delivery document that takes one *because of automation*. 

I'm not arguing against progress (how could you even stop progress?). The fact is, though, that we cannot pretend that there will be jobs to replace those that will be made obsolete due to AI/ML.

 >Player Piano is the first novel by American writer Kurt Vonnegut Jr., published in 1952. The novel depicts a dystopia of automation partly inspired by the author's time working at General Electric, describing the negative impact technology can have on quality of life. The story takes place in a near-future society that is almost totally mechanized, eliminating the need for human laborers. The widespread mechanization creates conflict between the wealthy upper class, the engineers and managers, who keep society running, and the lower class, whose skills and purpose in society have been replaced by machines.

You obviously did not even look at the source *which is linked in your quote*. Most (upward of 75%) [income for farming families is non-farm income](https://imgur.com/a/IXrJ40H). 

> People's unwillingness to move is a much bigger problem than automation.

Get fucked losers! Move to someplace new to do some shit job so you are a productive member of society! Who cares if you live in a house that's been in your family for generations? Who cares if you would be abandoning every support system you know? Feed the machine!

> Anything that requires non-trivial semantic interpretation, design, or planning.

The fact that you think some, or most, or even all of this won't be subject to automation shows shortsightedness.  Quantum computing is coming, and it will obsolete much of what we consider difficult or impossible computing today. AI/ML  will render things like engineering a bridge or diagnosing an allergy or air traffic control or programming *c* simple algorithmic problems. That is the point of it. It's purpose is to render difficult problems in which humans make mistakes into reproducible problems that can be handled consistently.  

Vonnegut wasn't predicting anything. I merely referenced his book as shorthand for what a society with more people than meaningful work could look like.

I'm not even sure what point you are trying to make.  I'm sorry if I misrepresented the numbers in the article you linked, but from what I can tell the main take away was that industrialization reduced the the wages for the majority of workers in the farming industry (small farms).  I think my point stands regardless of what the actual wage is:  if the wage is currently too low, then labor should reallocate itself such that wages increase.

&#x200B;

> Get fucked losers! 

You said this, not me.  I am encouraging people to become more agile and adapt to changes in the labor markets; you are acting like people needing to change jobs is some doomsday scenario.  It is a fact that labor will be reallocated by market forces.  If you want to live in a centrally planned economy I'm sure some shithole communist ""paradise"" will let you immigrate.  The goal of an economy should not be specific job preservation.  Attempting to do this will guarantee inefficiencies, and everyone will be worse off in the long run (including the people who's inefficient jobs were arbitrarily preserved).

>Move to someplace new to do some shit job so you are a productive member  of society! Who cares if you live in a house that's been in your family  for generations? Who cares if you would be abandoning every support  system you know? 

People need to do what is best for them.  These choices come with tradeoffs.  This is a fact of life.  Society actually doesn't care about how productive you are, other than through the price that they are willing to pay you for the labor that you are capable of doing.

>Quantum computing is coming, and it will obsolete much of what we consider difficult or impossible computing today. 

Please tell me if you are some professor at a university working on these sorts of problems.  I would really be out of my league arguing with someone who truly had deep knowledge of these sorts of problems.  It is my understanding that we are a long ways away from coming close to replicating the human brain.  AI/ML is a tool, just like any other tool that we use for specific tasks.  It requires humans to build the tool, it requires humans to train the tool, and it requires humans to use the tool and interpret its output.   It cannot self-replicate or deal with novel problems.  It can only function on tractable problems with manageable state space representations.  While quantum computing will make some computations more efficient, it will not solve the problem of complexity (i.e. easily solve NP problems), nor will it be able to deal with novel problems that require the development of new abstractions.  Human brains are not going to be replaced for a long time.  Again, if you are a research professor in some CS department I would be interested to hear your rebuttal to this.

>Vonnegut wasn't predicting anything. I merely referenced his book as  shorthand for what a society with more people than meaningful work could  look like. 

Ya this is a prediction: he is saying that there is some possible allocation of resources that is could occur as a result of some technology (haven't read the book, but this is what I gathered from the description).  There is no reason to think that this would happen.  If you think that Vonnegut, or you, or me can predict large scale economic changes then you don't know the first thing about economics.",1,1620411344.0
