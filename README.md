# Spring23_sentiment

This is the data repository for my Spring 2023 sentiment analysis project about how AI could potentially affect sentiments regarding the future of work. The "before" and "after" csv files are cleaned-up data from Reddit posts and comments before chatGPT was released (before Dec 1, 2022) and after it was released (on and after Dec 1, 2022). The posts searched using the terms "AI", "artificial intelligence", "chatgpt, "job", "worker", and were selected by the author to contain the most relevant information regarding AI, chatGPT and the future of work.
